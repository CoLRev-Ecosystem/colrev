          "abstract":["\nTo assess the evidence on SARS-CoV2 infection and Covid-19 in relation to deficiency and supplementation of vitamin D, we conducted a systematic review up to April 2021. We summarised data from 38 eligible studies, which presented risk estimates for at least one endpoint, including two RCT and 27 cohort-studies: 205565 patients with information on 25OHD status and 2022 taking vitamin D supplementation with a total of 1197 admitted to the ICU or who needed invasive mechanical ventilation or intubation and hospital stay, and more than 910 Covid-19 deaths. Primary outcomes were severity and mortality and the main aim was to evaluate the association with vitamin D supplementation. Random effects models showed that supplementation was associated with a significant lower risk of both Covid-19 severe disease (SRR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20–0.72, 6 studies) and mortality (SRR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17–0.70, 8 studies). There were no statistically significant dose differences between studies: summary estimates with regular doses remain statistically significant, suggesting that higher doses are not necessary. For patients on vitamin D supplementation, a greater reduction in mortality risk emerged in older individuals and at higher latitudes. Regarding the quality of studies, assessed using the New Castle-Ottawa quality scale, the analysis revealed in most cases no statistically significant differences between low, medium or high quality studies. We found significant associations of vitamin D supplementation with Covid-19, encompassing risks of disease worsening and mortality, especially in seasons characterized by 25OHD deficiency and with not severe patients. Dedicated randomized clinical studies are encouraged to confirm these results.\n"],

          "abstract":["\n        MUC16 (CA125) belongs to a family of high-molecular weight O-glycosylated proteins known as mucins. While MUC16 is well known as a biomarker in ovarian cancer, its expression pattern in pancreatic cancer (PC), the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States, remains unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of MUC16 during the initiation, progression and metastasis of PC for possible implication in PC diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. In this study, a microarray containing tissues from healthy and PC patients was used to investigate the differential protein expression of MUC16 in PC. MUC16 mRNA levels were also measured by RT-PCR in the normal human pancreatic, pancreatitis, and PC tissues. To investigate its expression pattern during PC metastasis, tissue samples from the primary pancreatic tumor and metastases (from the same patient) in the lymph nodes, liver, lung and omentum from Stage IV PC patients were analyzed. To determine its association in the initiation of PC, tissues from PC patients containing pre-neoplastic lesions of varying grades were stained for MUC16. Finally, MUC16 expression was analyzed in 18 human PC cell lines. MUC16 is not expressed in the normal pancreatic ducts and is strongly upregulated in PC and detected in pancreatitis tissue. It is first detected in the high-grade pre-neoplastic lesions preceding invasive adenocarcinoma, suggesting that its upregulation is a late event during the initiation of this disease. MUC16 expression appears to be stronger in metastatic lesions when compared to the primary tumor, suggesting a role in PC metastasis. We have also identified PC cell lines that express MUC16, which can be used in future studies to elucidate its functional role in PC. Altogether, our results reveal that MUC16 expression is significantly increased in PC and could play a potential role in the progression of this disease.\n      "],

          "abstract":["\n        Schemes designed to make farming landscapes less hostile to wildlife have been questioned because target taxa do not always respond in the expected manner. Microbats are often overlooked in this process, yet persist in agricultural landscapes and exert top-down control of crop pests. We investigated the relationship between microbats and measures commonly incorporated into agri-environment schemes, to derive management recommendations for their ongoing conservation. We used acoustic detectors to quantify bat species richness, activity, and feeding in 32 linear remnants and adjacent fields across an agricultural region of New South Wales, Australia. Nocturnal arthropods were simultaneously trapped using black-light traps. We recorded 91,969 bat calls, 17,277 of which could be attributed to one of the 13 taxa recorded, and 491 calls contained feeding buzzes. The linear remnants supported higher bat activity than the fields, but species richness and feeding activity did not significantly differ. We trapped a mean 87.6 g (±17.6 g SE) of arthropods per night, but found no differences in biomass between land uses. Wider linear remnants with intact native vegetation supported more bat species, as did those adjacent to unsealed, as opposed to sealed roads. Fields of unimproved native pastures, with more retained scattered trees and associated hollows and logs, supported the greatest bat species richness and activity. We conclude that the juxtaposition of linear remnants of intact vegetation and scattered trees in fields, coupled with less-intensive land uses such as unimproved pastures will benefit bat communities in agricultural landscapes, and should be incorporated into agri-environment schemes. In contrast, sealed roads may act as a deterrent. The “wildlife friendly farming” vs “land sparing” debate has so far primarily focussed on birds, but here we have found evidence that the integration of both approaches could particularly benefit bats.\n      "],

Prenatal and labor-related complications may hinder breastfeeding, but supportive hospital practices may encourage women who intend to breastfeed. We measured the relationship between having a complex pregnancy (entering pregnancy with hypertension, diabetes, or obesity) and early infant feeding, accounting for breastfeeding intentions and supportive hospital practices. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a nationally-representative survey of women who gave birth in 2011–2012 in a US hospital (N = 2400). We used logistic regression to examine the relationship between pregnancy complexity and breastfeeding. Self-reported prepregnancy diabetes or hypertension, gestational diabetes, or obesity indicated a complex pregnancy. The outcome was feeding status 1 week postpartum; any breastfeeding was evaluated among women intending to breastfeed (N = 1990), and exclusive breastfeeding among women who intended to exclusively breastfeed (N = 1418). We also tested whether breastfeeding intentions or supportive hospital practices mediated the relationship between pregnancy complexity and infant feeding status. Results: More than 33% of women had a complex pregnancy; these women had 30% lower odds of intending to breastfeed (AOR = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52–0.98). Rates of intention to exclusively breastfeed were similar for women with and without complex pregnancies. Women who intended to breastfeed had similar rates of any breastfeeding 1 week postpartum regardless of pregnancy complexity, but complexity was associated with >30% lower odds of exclusive breastfeeding 1 week among women who intended to exclusively breastfeed (AOR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47–0.98). Supportive hospital practices were strongly associated with higher odds of any or exclusive breastfeeding 1 week postpartum (AOR = 4.03; 95% CI, 1.81–8.94; and AOR = 2.68; 95% CI, 1.70–4.23, respectively). Conclusions: Improving clinical and hospital support for women with complex pregnancies may increase breastfeeding rates and the benefits of breastfeeding for women and infants. "],

However, the underlying molecular mechanism of BPA induced impairment in learning and memory is not well known. As synaptic plasticity is the cellular basis of memory, the present study investigated the effect of perinatal exposure to BPA on the expression of synaptic proteins neurexin1 (Nrxn1) and neuroligin3 (Nlgn3), dendritic spine density and spatial memory in postnatal male mice. The pregnant mice were orally administered BPA (50 µg/kgbw/d) from gestation day (GD) 7 to postnatal day (PND) 21 and sesame oil was used as a vehicle control. In Morris water maze (MWM) test, BPA extended the escape latency time to locate the hidden platform in 8 weeks male mice. RT-PCR and Immunoblotting results showed significant upregulation of Nrxn1 and Nlgn3 expression in both cerebral cortex and hippocampus of 3 and 8 weeks male mice. This was further substantiated by in-situ hybridization and immunofluorescence techniques. BPA also significantly increased the density of dendritic spines in both regions, as analyzed by rapid Golgi staining. Thus our data suggest that perinatal exposure to BPA impairs spatial memory through upregulation of expression of synaptic proteins Nrxn1 and Nlgn3 and increased dendritic spine density in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of postnatal male mice.\n"],

Furthermore, numerous studies on BH4-sensitive PAH deficiency have been conducted. To date, BH4, a cofactor of PAH, has not been used to treat PKU in Russia.Genotype data of patients with PKU can be used to predict their sensitivity to BH4 therapy. A cohort of 2579 patients with PKU from Russia was analyzed for 25 common PAH gene mutations using custom allele-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification-based technology. A mutation detection rate of 84.1% chromosomes was accomplished. Both pathogenic alleles were identified in 73.1% of patients. The most frequent pathogenic variants were p.Arg408Trp (50.9%), p.Arg261Gln (5.3%), p.Pro281Leu (3.5%), IVS12+1G>A (3.1%), IVS10-11G>A (2.6%), and p.Arg158Leu (2.4%). The exact boundaries of a PAH exon 5 deletion were defined as EX5del4154ins268 (c.442-2913_509+1173del4154ins268). Severe phenotypes prevailed in the cohort, and classical PKU was observed in 71.8% cases. Due to the genotype-based prediction, 55.9% of the probands were non-responders to the BH4-treatment, and 20.2% were potential responders. Analysis of genotype data is useful to predict BH4 response in PKU patients. The high rate of non-responders among Russian patients was due to the high allele frequency of severe PAH mutations.\n"],

          "abstract":["\nLong noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of functional non-coding transcripts that are longer than 200 nt and regulate gene expression via diverse mechanisms in eukaryotes. In fact, they have emerged as critical epigenetic and transcriptional regulators of autophagy in mammals in response to various stressors. Autophagy not only plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis, but it is also essential to immunity, targets intracellular pathogens for degradation, modulates inflammation, and participates in adaptive immune responses. However, the expression profile of lncRNA and its role in regulating autophagy in macrophages have been poorly defined. Here, we used transcriptomic and bioinformatics to analysis LncRNA expression profile during autophagy and functional studies to evaluate the function of the metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript-1 (Malat1) lncRNA in macrophages. A total of 1112 putative lncRNAs (240 novel lncRNAs) were identified, including 831 large intergenic, 129 intronic, and 152 anti-sense lncRNA, of which 59 differentially expressed transcripts exhibited a greater than 1.5-fold change under different conditions. The interaction of Malat1 lncRNA with microRNA (mir)-23-3p and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (Lamp1) was found, Malat1 releases inhibition of Lamp1 expression in macrophages through competitive adsorption of mir-23-3p. The results of this study provide a better understanding of lncRNA function in macrophages and a basis for further investigation into the roles and mechanisms of ncRNA in immunology, particularly the functions of Malat1 and mir-23-3p in the pathogenesis of macrophages.\n"],

          "abstract":["\nInvestigating whether landmarks and routes affect navigational efficiency and learning transfer in traffic is essential. In this study, a virtual reality-based driving system was employed to determine the effects of landmarks and routes on human neurocognitive behavior. The participants made four (4) journeys to predetermined destinations. They were provided with different landmarks and routes to aid in reaching their respective destinations. We considered two (2) groups and conducted two (2) sessions per group in this study. Each group had sufficient and insufficient landmarks. We hypothesized that using insufficient landmarks would elicit an increase in psychophysiological activation, such as increased heart rate, eye gaze, and pupil size, which would cause participants to make more errors. Moreover, easy and difficult routes elicited different cognitive workloads. Thus, a high cognitive load would negatively affect the participants when trying to apply the knowledge acquired at the beginning of the exercise. In addition, the navigational efficiency of routes with sufficient landmarks was remarkably higher than that of routes with insufficient landmarks. We evaluated the effects of landmarks and routes by assessing the recorded information of the drivers’ pupil size, heart rate, and driving performance data. An analytical strategy, several machine learning algorithms, and data fusion methods have been employed to measure the neurocognitive load of each participant for user classification. The results showed that insufficient landmarks and difficult routes increased pupil size and heart rate, which caused the participants to make more errors. The results also indicated that easy routes with sufficient landmarks were deemed more efficient for navigation, where users’ cognitive loads were much lower than those with insufficient landmarks and difficult routes. The high cognitive workload hindered the participants when trying to apply the knowledge acquired at the beginning of the exercise. Meanwhile, the data fusion method achieved higher accuracy than the other classification methods. The results of this study will help improve the use of landmarks and design of driving routes, as well as paving the way to analyze traffic safety using the drivers’ cognition and performance data.\n"],

Intra-muscular-7α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17P) has been the preventive treatment of choice until the recent “Prolong study” that reported no benefit. Objective: To determine the benefit of (17P) treatment in preventing reoccurrence of sPTB, by evaluating two presenting symptoms of the first sPTB: premature contractions (PMC) and preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM). Study design: This retrospective study included 342 women with a previous singleton sPTB followed by a subsequent pregnancy. sPTB were either due to PMC (n = 145) or pPROM (n = 197). During the subsequent pregnancy, 90 (26.3%) patients received 250 mg 17P IM. Each presenting symptom–PMC or pPROM–was evaluated within itself comparing treated vs. untreated groups. Data were analyzed using t-test, Chi-square and Fisher’s exact test. Logistic regression analysis was also performed. Results: Patients treated with 17P in the subsequent pregnancy had delivered earlier in the previous pregnancy (33.4w vs. 35.3w in the PMC group, and 34.1w vs. 35.7w in the pPROM group, p<0.001). In the following pregnancy, they had higher admission rates due to suspected preterm labor (31.7% vs. 10.9% in the treated vs. untreated PMC group (p = 0.003) and 26.1% vs. 5.4% in the treated vs. untreated pPROM group (p<0.001). In both groups, but more prominently in the previous PMC group, treatment compared to non-treatment in the subsequent pregnancy significantly prolonged it (4.3w vs. 2.6w in the PMC group (p = 0.007), and 3.7w vs. 2.7w in the pPROM group (p = 0.018)). Conclusions: 17P might delay preterm delivery in patients with a previous sPTB on an individual level (prolongation of the pregnancy for each patient compared to her previous delivery). Therefore, our results imply that 17P can decrease potential premature delivery complications for patients with a previous sPTB due to PMC or pPROM. "],

Although hypoglycaemia is a frequent complication of insulin therapy, it is often under-appreciated. We conducted a scoping review of this important complication, and of other adverse effects, of the treatment of hyperkalaemia in hospitalised adults to map existing research on this topic and to identify any knowledge gaps. Materials and methods: We followed the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they reported on any adverse effects in hospitalised patients ≥18-years-old, with hyperkalaemia receiving treatment that included insulin. All eligible research from 1980 to 12 October 2021 were included. We searched Medline (PubMed), Embase (Ovid), the Cochrane Library, CINHAL, Africa-Wide Information, Web of Science Core Collection, LILACS and Epistemonikos. The protocol was prospectively registered with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/x8cs9). Results: Sixty-two articles were included. The prevalence of hypoglycaemia by any definition was 17.2% (95% CI 16.6–17.8%). The median timing of hypoglycaemia was 124 minutes after insulin administration (IQR 102–168 minutes). There were no differences in the prevalence of hypoglycaemia when comparing insulin dose (<10 units vs. ≥10 units), rate of insulin administration (continuous vs. bolus), type of insulin (regular vs. short-acting) or timing of insulin administration relative to dextrose. However, lower insulin doses were associated with a reduced prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia (3.5% vs. 5.9%, P = 0.02). There was no difference regarding prevalence of hypoglycaemia by dextrose dose (≤25 g vs. >25 g); however, prevalence was lower when dextrose was administered as a continuous infusion compared with bolus administration (3.3% vs. 19.5%, P = 0.02). The most common predictor of hypoglycaemia was the pre-treatment serum glucose concentration (n = 13 studies), which ranged from < 5.6–7.8 mmol/L. Conclusion: This is the first comprehensive review of the adverse effects following insulin therapy for hyperkalaemia. Hypoglycaemia remains a common adverse effect in hospitalised adults. Future randomised trials should focus on identifying the optimal regimen of insulin therapy to mitigate the risk of hypoglycaemia. "],
