          "abstract":["\n        To penetrate susceptible cells, HIV-1 sequentially interacts with two highly conserved cellular receptors, CD4 and a chemokine receptor like CCR5 or CXCR4. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) directed against such receptors are currently under clinical investigation as potential preventive or therapeutic agents. We immunized Balb/c mice with molecular complexes of the native, trimeric HIV-1 envelope (Env) bound to a soluble form of the human CD4 receptor. Sera from immunized mice were found to contain gp120-CD4 complex-enhanced antibodies and showed broad-spectrum HIV-1-inhibitory activity. A proportion of MAbs derived from these mice preferentially recognized complex-enhanced epitopes. In particular, a CD4-specific MAb designated DB81 (IgG1Κ) was found to preferentially bind to a complex-enhanced epitope on the D2 domain of human CD4. MAb DB81 also recognized chimpanzee CD4, but not baboon or macaque CD4, which exhibit sequence divergence in the D2 domain. Functionally, MAb DB81 displayed broad HIV-1-inhibitory activity, but it did not exert suppressive effects on T-cell activation in vitro. The variable regions of the heavy and light chains of MAb DB81 were sequenced. Due to its broad-spectrum anti-HIV-1 activity and lack of immunosuppressive effects, a humanized derivative of MAb DB81 could provide a useful complement to current preventive or therapeutic strategies against HIV-1.\n      "],

          "abstract":["\nAlthough ethylene is well known as an essential regulator of fruit development, little work has examined the role ethylene plays in the development and maturation of mulberry (Morus L.) fruit. To study the mechanism of ethylene action during fruit development in this species, we measured the ethylene production, fruit firmness, and soluble solids content (SSC) during fruit development and harvest. By comparing the results with those from other climacteric fruit, we concluded that Morus fruit are probably climacteric. Genes associated with the ethylene signal transduction pathway of Morus were characterized from M. notabilis Genome Database, including four ethylene receptor genes, a EIN2-like gene, a CTR1-like gene, four EIN3-like genes, and a RTE1-like gene. The expression patterns of these genes were analyzed in the fruit of M. atropurpurea cv. Jialing No.40. During fruit development, transcript levels of MaETR2, MaERS, MaEIN4, MaRTE, and MaCTR1 were lower at the early stages and higher after 26 days after full bloom (DAF), while MaETR1, MaEIL1, MaEIL2, and MaEIL3 remained constant. In ripening fruit, the transcripts of MaACO1 and MaACS3 increased, while MaACS1 and MaACO2 decreased after harvest. The transcripts of MaACO1, MaACO2, and MaACS3 were inhibited by ethylene, and 1-MCP (1–methylcyclopropene) upregulated MaACS3. The transcripts of the MaETR-like genes, MaRTE, and MaCTR1 were inhibited by ethylene and 1-MCP, suggesting that ethylene may accelerate the decline of MaETRs transcripts. No significant changes in the expression of MaEIN2, MaEIL1, and MaEIL3 were observed during ripening or in response to ethylene, while the expressions of MaEIL2 and MaEIL4 increased rapidly after 24 h after harvest (HAH) and were upregulated by ethylene. The present study provides insights into ethylene biosynthesis and signal transduction in Morus plants and lays a foundation for the further understanding of the mechanisms underlying Morus fruit development and ripening.\n"],

          "abstract":["\nThis paper presents an evaluation of the effectiveness of two types of deceleration markings on freeways in China: fishbone-shaped (FS) markings and edge-rate (ER) markings. An actual 4-lane, 6-km long freeway in Province Hebei was created in a driving simulator and used for the experiments. Three scenarios of deceleration markings were adopted: one without markings, one with FS markings, and the third with ER markings. For each scenario, three traffic flow levels were adopted (low, medium, and heavy). The appropriate dimensions of deceleration markings were first established using relevant design guidelines and then used to develop the simulation scenarios using Multigen Creator software. Sixty drivers carried out the simulation experiments with eye tracker equipment. The adequacy of deceleration markings was analyzed with respect to speed, perceived distance, pupil diameter, and geometric parameters. The results showed that both types of deceleration markings made a certain effect on vehicle speed, drivers’visual behavior, and mental characteristics. However, the effect of the FS markings was more pronounced than that of the ER marking. Specifically, the FS markings showed a speed reduction of 12.3 km/h to 15.2 km/h and a perceived distance of 70 m to 90 m, compared with 6.7 km/h to 9.9 km/h and 40 m to 60 m, respectively, for the ER markings. Application comments of the results are provided in the conclusion.\n"],

          "abstract":["\nOver the last few decades, the Internet has experienced tremendous growth in data traffic. This continuous growth due to the increase in the number of connected devices and platforms has dramatically boosted content consumption. However, retrieving content from the servers of Content Providers (CPs) can increase network traffic and incur high network delay and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a joint deep learning and auction-based approach for congestion-aware caching in Named Data Networking (NDN), which aims to prevent congestion and minimize the content downloading delays. First, using recorded network traffic data on the Internet Service Provider (ISP) network, we propose a deep learning model to predict future traffic over transit links. Second, to prevent congestion and avoid high latency on transit links, which may experience congestion in the future; we propose a caching model that helps the ISP to cache content that has a high predicted future demand. Paid-content requires payment to be downloaded and cached. Therefore, we propose an auction mechanism to obtain paid-content at an optimal price. The simulation results show that our proposal prevents congestion and increases the profits of both ISPs and CPs.\n"],

          "abstract":["\nCytokeratin 19 (KRT19) protein is highly expressed in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, hepatobiliary tissues, and pancreas of humans and mice. In the present study, we used an improved Cre (iCre) gene to enhance the efficiency of Cre expression in mammalian cells. We established a new transgenic Krt19-iCre bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) mouse model using the BAC recombineering strategy. Site-specific iCre expression pattern was examined in embryos, adults, and elderly Krt19-iCre mice crossed with Tomato or LacZ reporter mice. Both iCre and reporter protein expressions in adult Krt19-iCre;Tomatoflox/+ (Krt19-iCre Tomato reporter) mice were observed mainly in the epithelial cells of the GI tract, hepatobiliary tissues, and pancreas. However, the expression in the intrahepatic and small pancreatic duct were lower than those in the common bile and large pancreatic duct. In the Krt19-iCre; LacZ reporter embryos, β-galactosidase for the LacZ reporter was expressed in the glandular epithelial cells of the GI tract in 9.5-day embryos, 12-day embryos, and newborn mice. The reporter protein expression in Krt19-iCre-Tomato reporter mice was consistent with the KRT19 expression in human GI tissues. In conclusion, Krt19-iCre BAC transgenic mice can be used to investigate developmental and pathological conditions using the iCre-loxP system.\n"],

          "abstract":["\nThis paper proposes a method to quantitatively identify the changes of technological paradigm over time. Specifically, the method identifies previous paradigms and predicts future paradigms by analyzing a patent citation-based knowledge network. The technological paradigm can be considered as dominantly important knowledge in a specific period. Therefore, we adopted the knowledge persistence which can quantify technological impact of an invention to recent technologies in a knowledge network. High knowledge persistence patents are dominant or paradigmatic inventions in a specific period and so changes of top knowledge persistence patents over time can show paradigm shifts. Moreover, since knowledge persistence of paradigmatic inventions are increasing dramatically faster than other ordinary inventions, recent patents having similar increasing trends in knowledge persistence with previous paradigms are identified as future paradigm inventions. We conducted an empirical case study using patents related to the genome sequencing technology. The results show that the identified previous paradigms are widely recognized as critical inventions in the domain by other studies and the identified future paradigms are also qualitatively significant inventions as promising technologies.\n"],

          "abstract":["\nLipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria activates pro-inflammatory pathways, dys-regulates the function of endometrial cells and is a key player in the mechanisms involved in endometritis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LPS on bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEEC) from whole transcriptome with a special focus on genes involved in embryo-maternal interactions. Following in vitro culture, bEEC from three cows were exposed to 0, 2, and 8 μg/mL LPS for 24h. RNA samples extracted at 0 and 24 hours were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). At 24h, 2035 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between controls and samples treated with 2 μg/mL LPS. Gene ontology analysis showed that over-expressed DEGs were associated to immune response, response to stress and external stimuli, catalytic activity, and cell cycle. Genes associated with cell membrane and cell adhesion pathways were under-expressed. LPS induced changes in expression of specific genes related to embryo-maternal interactions including under-expression of eight members of the cadherin superfamily, over-expression of six members of the mucin family, and differential expression of a large set of genes binding the above molecules and of more than 20 transcripts coding for cytokines and their receptors. Type I interferon-τ dependent genes were also over-expressed. From a sub-set of 19 genes, (biological replicates of bEEC from cows taken at time 6 (n = 3), 24 (n = 6) and 48 hours (n = 3), and 2 technical replicates per sample) differential gene expression was confirmed by RT2-qPCR (r2 between fold changes at 24 hours by RT2-qPCR and RNA-seq = 0.97). These results indicate that LPS affects the function of bEEC in many ways by differential transcription, glycolytic metabolism and oxidative stress. Many transcriptomic signatures related to implantation and embryo maternal interactions were strongly affected by LPS. These results pave the way for further studies to investigate the duration of these changes and their possible impact on endometrial function and fertility.\n"],

The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which patients referred for exercise consultation within a clinical cancer prevention setting were meeting aerobic and resistance physical activity (PA) guidelines and to identify factors associated with guideline adherence. Between 2013 and 2015, cancer prevention patients and cancer survivors were interviewed by an exercise physiologist within an Integrative Health Program at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Prevention Center. PA adherence was defined as at least 150-minutes of moderate-intensity or 75-minutes of vigorous-intensity PA per week, along with resistance training at least 2 days per week. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with meeting or not meeting PA guidelines for aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and aerobic and resistance exercise combined. Among 1,024 cancer prevention patients and survivors, 9% of patients adhered to guideline-based PA. Adherence to aerobic and resistance guidelines were 20% and 12%, respectively. Overweight or obesity was associated with not meeting guideline-based PA in both cancer prevention patients and cancer survivors. Among breast cancer survivors, combination treatment with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy (‘multimodal therapy’) was robustly associated with not meeting aerobic guidelines (OR 2.20, 95% CI: 1.17 to 4.16). BMI and breast cancer treatment history are key determinants of PA behavior among cancer prevention patients and survivors. Poor adherence to PA guidelines is a key issue for cancer prevention patients and survivors, particularly obese patients and women who receive multimodal therapy for breast cancer. Identifying and connecting patients at highest risk of poor PA adherence with exercise programs is needed to improve PA, a key modifiable cancer risk factor.\n"],
