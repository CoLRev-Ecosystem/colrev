CoLRev development environment setup
====================================

This document describes the setup of a development environment for the
CoLRev project. Although we only support the systems listed in the
compatibility section, useful hints for the setup on other machines can
be contributed to this repository (issues or pull-requests).

The setup includes: 

-  Python3, pip 
-  git 
-  Docker 
-  CoLRev 
-  Continuous integration (pre-commit hooks) 
-  Visual Studio Code

Compatibility
-------------

Windows: 10/11 via WSL2 with Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS (`setup with “The one
line
install!” <https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#3-download-ubuntu>`__)

macOS: via Virtual Machine

Linux: `Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS <https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop>`__ and
`Debian 11.7
“Bullseye” <https://www.debian.org/releases/bullseye/debian-installer/>`__

Note: Current Non-LTS versions (22.10, 23.04, 23.10) of Ubuntu and
Debian 12 “Bookworm” are not supported due to a change in the handling
of the `pip package
manager <https://itsfoss.com/install-pipx-ubuntu/>`__. Support for newer
Linux distributions is scheduled for April 2024 with the next LTS
release of Ubuntu.
