In the ``colrev load`` operation, search results are added to the main records file following a three-step procedure:

1. For each search results file (in the ``data/search`` directory), the SearchSource and search parameters are validated. For API-based searches, the SearchSource and search parameters are already recorded in the ``settings.json``. For search result files, `heuristics <https://colrev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/foundations/extensions.html#colrev.env.package_manager.SearchSourcePackageEndpointInterface.heuristic>`_ are used to identify the SearchSource (e.g., GoogleScholar or Web of Science) and users are asked to provide the corresponding search parameters, which are stored in the ``settings.json``.

2. Load conversion packages are used to convert different filetypes to BiBTeX (see table below) and to apply `fixes <https://colrev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/foundations/extensions.html#colrev.env.package_manager.SearchSourcePackageEndpointInterface.load_fixes>`_ ensuring consistent field names.

3. Records from the search result files are identified based on unique `origin IDs` and added to the main records file (``data/records.bib``). Additional metadata fields are created upon import, including the ``colrev_status``, the ``colrev_origin``, as well as ``colrev_masterdata_provenance`` and ``colrev_data_provenance``. The provenance fields indicate whether the record has quality defects (such as missing fields).

.. code:: bash

	colrev load [options]

Notes on the load conversion:

- Structured formats (csv, xlsx) are imported using standard Python libraries
- Semi-structured formats are imported using bibtexparser or the zotero-translation services (see `supported import formats <https://www.zotero.org/support/kb/importing_standardized_formats>`_)
- Unstructured formats are imported using Grobid (lists of references and pdf reference lists)

The following options for ``load_conversion`` are available:

.. datatemplate:json:: ../../../../colrev/template/package_endpoints.json

    {{ make_list_table_from_mappings(
        [("Identifier", "package_endpoint_identifier"), ("Load conversion packages", "short_description"), ("Status", "status_linked")],
        data['load_conversion'],
        title='',
        columns=[25,55,20]
        ) }}
