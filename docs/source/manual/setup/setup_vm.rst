Setup with VirtualBox
=====================

A fully installed VirtualBox image is available
`here <https://gigamove.rwth-aachen.de/de/download/29146e80c3ec3e691e35b4866e9573c9>`__.
If the link has expired, please contact `Gerit
Wagner <mailto:gerit.wagner@uni-bamberg.de>`__.

After unpacking the VirtualBox Image, open the ``colrev_dev.vbox`` file
in `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`__. To avoid performance
issues, the following settings are recommended:

::

   Set Acceleration manually to KVM, if not already set by default:
   Settings > System > Acceleration > Paravirtualization Interface > KVM

   Allocate at least 4096 MB of system memory to your guest system (Ubuntu recommended requirements):
   Settings > System > Motherboard > set the slider "Base Memory" to 4096 MB or higher (stay within green margin)

   Allocate at least 2 CPU cores to your guest system (Ubuntu recommended requirements):
   Settings > System > Processor > set the slider "Processors" to 2 CPUs (stay within green margin)

   Allocate 128 MB of video memory to your guest system:
   Settings > Display > Screen > set the slider "Video Memory" to 128 MB

   If you encounter any graphical glitches or errors, consider turning off 3D acceleration temporarily:
   Settings > Display > Screen > uncheck "Enabale 3D Acceleration"

Start the machine, and log in (account: ``ubuntu``, password:
``ubuntu``).

Install the guest additions for a better integration between host and
guest system

::

   Open a Terminal an run the following command:
   sudo apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso

   To activate copy-paste between the VM and your OS:
   Devices > Shared Clipboard > Bidirectional
