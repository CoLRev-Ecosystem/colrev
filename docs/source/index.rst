Colaborative Literature Reviews
========================================

The Colaborative Literature Reviews (CoLRev) framework provides a standardized environment, an extensible core engine, and a reference implementation for conducting highly collaborative reviews with a team of researchers and state-of-the-art algorithms.
A reliable and efficient literature review process requires:

- a standard data structure
- a shared model for the steps of the review process
- dedicated procedures for metadata and fulltext preparation
- principles for trustworthy use of algorithmic and crowdsourced changes
- a powerful versioning system (git) that makes changes transparent
- collaboration principles that are monitored automatically

CoLRev aspires to be self-explanatory, to anticipate, prevent, and resolve errors, and thereby allow researchers to orchestrate researcher-crowd-machine ensembles with confidence.
Simply `install the colrev environment <guides/installation.html>`_ and run

.. code-block::

   colrev status

This command displays the current state of the review and guides you to the next steps (see `guidelines <guides/overview.html>`_).
After each processing step, make sure to `check the changes <guides/changes.html>`_, effectively following a three-step cycle:
