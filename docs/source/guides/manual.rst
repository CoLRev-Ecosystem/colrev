Literature reviews with CoLRev
==================================

The CoLRev explains how to use the functionality of CoLRev when conducting a literature review. It covers the user workflow, the processing operations, as well as collaboration and curation.
It does not explain the design and architecture of CoLRev, which are covered in the `technical documentation <../technical_documentation/colrev>`_ and the `API reference <../technical_documentation/api>`_.
Our goal is to provide a manual that is self-contained. Yet, it can help to be familiar with the basics of git - for example by catching up with one of the interactive and free tutorials available online (`tutorial <https://learngitbranching.js.org/>`_).

.. TODO : elaborate on prerequisites?

**Installation**

CoLRev is implemented in Python and should be compatible with Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
After installing `git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ and `docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_:

.. code-block::

   # Install
   pip install colrev

Installing the command-line interface automatically installs the CoLRev-core and CoLRev-hooks.
Extensions are available in the `extensions section <guides/manual/A_appendix.html>`_ and on `GitHub <https://github.com/topics/colrev-extension>`_.

**Python venv**

It is recommended to run CoLRev in a virtual environment.
CoLRev relies on several fixed-version dependencies for reproducibility and venv helps to avoid dependency conflicts with other packages.

.. TODO : at some point, we may start to include links to other resources/tutorials/workshops

.. code-block::

    # To create
    python -m venv myvenv

    # To activate (Linux)
    source myvenv/bin/activate

    # To activate (Windows)
    myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
