1. Workflow
==================================

This chapter will teach you how to use the CoLRev workflow.
Conducting a literature review is very challenging, requiring authors to keep track of individual papers, steps, and collaborative changes.
In CoLRev, you should only have to know the colrev status command and ...

Mention agreement on a shared data structure and steps of the literature review

.. The main purpose of the three-step workflow is to make your work easier.

CoLRev status
-------------------------------

The CoLRev status command serves as a starting point for all steps and helps to make CoLRev self-explanatory.
It consists of the following (as shown below):

- The **status section**, which provides an overview of the review project and reports the state of the records in the process

- The **instructions section**, which provides situational instructions on the next steps of the review project (highlighted in yellow), versioning and collaboration, and the local CoLRev environment

- The **checks section**, which checks consistency of file formats and structure


`colrev status` should provide all necessary instructions for your project.

.. code-block:: bash

   Checks

     ReviewManager.format()      ...  Everything ok.


CoLRev operation
-------------------------------

The status provides an overview of the six steps and corresponding operations.
The sequence of steps and operations as well as the corresponding state transitions of records are standardized across CoLRev projects.
Within this standardized structure, each operation can be configured.
Through the settings, it is possible to rely on the default configuration (the CoLRev reference implementation with reasonable parameters), to adapt selected parameters, to plug in CoLRev packages (community packages or custom built ones).

Step Search
   - Operation: Search
Step Metadata
   - Operation: Load
   - Operation: Prep
   - Operation: Dedupe
Step Prescreen
   - Operation: Prescreen
Step PDFs
   - Operation: PDF get
   - Operation: PDF prep
Step Screen
   - Operation: Screen
Step Data
   - Operation: Data
   - Operation: Paper

Operations lead records to transition between states as illustrated in the following

CoLRev validate
-------------------------------

After each step, check and validate the changes using

.. code-block:: bash

      colrev validate

TODO : include example of colrev validate

..
   Using git, you can validate the individual changes and the commit report for each version.
   Instructions on how to correct and trace errors are available in the guidelines for the respective step.

CoLRev also ensures that the git-diffs are readable:

TODO : update (e.g., colrev_origin, provenance fields)

.. code-block:: diff

   @inproceedings{BurtchWattalGhose2012,
      origin              = {scopus.bib/Burtch20123329},
   -  status              = {md_imported},
   +  status              = {md_prepared},
   -  metadata_source     = {ORIGINAL},
   +  metadata_source     = {CURATED},
   -  author              = {Burtch, G. and Wattal, S. and Ghose, A.},
   +  author              = {Burtch, Gordon and Ghose, Anindya and Wattal, Sunil},
   -  booktitle           = {International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2012},
   +  booktitle           = {International Conference on Information Systems},
   -  title               = {An Empirical Examination of Cultural Biases in Interpersonal Economic Exchange},
   +  title               = {An empirical examination of cultural biases in interpersonal economic exchange},
      year                = {2012},
      pages               = {3329--3346},
      volume              = {4},
      note                = {cited By 4},
   +  url                 = {http://aisel.aisnet.org/icis2012/proceedings/GlobalIssues/6},
   }

Note: you can also use a `git client of your choice <https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis>`_.

      A git commit report provides a higher-level overview of the repository's state:
