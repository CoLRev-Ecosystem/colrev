# CoLRev development

## Codespaces

- Start the codespace session on your target branch/fork.
- Remember to [stop](https://docs.github.com/de/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/stopping-and-starting-a-codespace) the codespace after the development session.
- **Warning**: If you *delete* the codespace, your changes are deleted.

## Project vs. package directory

commands/separate terminals

## Development best practices

Changes/commits/tests/git graph (local?)



TODO :
- TBD: pip install -e .?
